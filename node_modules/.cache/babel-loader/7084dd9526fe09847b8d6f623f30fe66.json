occasion in a girl’s lifetime. And with the music, dances, people making merry all around, celebrating the beginning of a beautiful bond, it’s an unforgettable time. But for the bride, wedding trousseau is something that stands out, more so her vanity box. It is also one of the very old traditional rituals in many Indian weddings, wherein the father or mother of the bride gifts her the most beautiful vanity box as an emotional going away present. This is why it’s such a vital asset for a girl, a going away gift that she cherishes for long while entering her new life.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>Vanity Box Essentials</p>\r\n                                                    <p>What all a bride should include in the vanity box is another important thing to consider and choose very selectively as these are the products which the bride uses for most for upcoming meet and greets with the groom’s family and friends and is bestowed with all that extra attention. And as every girl is super excited about her wedding, they are sure to invest time in planning every minute detail so why not take care of all the make-up necessities that the beautiful box has to hold for you. Here goes a finely chosen list of the best products that deserve a place in the box. </p>\r\n                                                    <p>1.  \tPrimer & Foundation- Primer is the very base on which your entire make-up look is built, if the base isn’t strong the make-up won’t last long and gets patchy. Foundation too must be a perfect match for your skin tone to make the make-up look natural and not artificial. There are many brands that offer a great collection of both with L’Oréal, M.A.C, Smashbox and Colorbar being at the top in base make-up.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>2.  \tConcealer- A concealer is a must for levelling out your skin patches or uneven skin tone as well as any pigmentation. It must sit well with your base make-up to blend right in. You can opt from Maybelline’s range of concealers or L.A. Girl Pro Conceal or the SUGAR Magic Wand Waterproof Concealer among others. Brides can also choose to get a colour corrector alongside if they like.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>3.  \tTranslucent Powder- Translucent loose powder in a natural shade adds to the finesse of your look and gives it a settling touch, again making it natural and dewy. Select from a range of translucent powders available from brands like SUGAR, Kay Beauty or L’Oréal.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>4.  \tBlush & Highlighter- Adding some soft colour to your cheeks is a must so that you don’t look too pale with all the brightening products. You can also buy an Highlighter and use it as an altering one with blush. We would suggest buying a palette that has both for easy application. Go for the L.A. Colors So Cheeky Palette or the complete contouring palette by Makeup Revolution or Smashbox.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>5.  \tEye Make-up- Getting the eye make-up look right is also a task but an enjoyable one as decorating the eyes can be fun. Just remember to not overdo it and highlight either the eyes or the lips and never both. Make sure to add a nice kajal, eyeliner, mascara and a nice eyeshadow palette. Pick out from popular brands like Lakme’s kajal, Maybelline’s mascara, Colorbar eye liner and Huda Beauty eyeshadow range.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>6.  \tLip Colour & Lip Balm- No make-up kit is complete without a fairly wide range of lipsticks, lip glosses and lip pencils. You must cover all basic nude shades, reds, pinks and corals to have a decent one to pair with all your gorgeous outfits. A lip pencil is a must to define your lips and the most vital is to get a nice lip balm to give a protective coating to your lips beforehand. M.A.C., SUGAR, Kiko Milano, Revlon, L’Oréal and Lakme have a wide range of lip shades to choose from. You will be spoilt for choice.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>7.  \tMake-up Brush Set- Definitely not to miss is a set of good quality make-up brush set including all types of brushes for a smooth application. Without the right brush, even the best make-up won’t give that finesse that it is capable of. Also, don’t forget to grab a good beauty blender for blending your make-up well to enhance your whole look with simply blending it well. Huda Beauty, Colorbar, Vega and Sigma Beauty offer an amazing range of brushes to suit every hand, be it expert or learner.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>8.  \tMake-up Remover & Moisturizer- Last but by no means the least, comes the very crucial two products, a good, chemical free make-up remover to get rid of all that artificial beauty after a tiring day or event and a nice, rejuvenating moisturizing that encompasses both the first and last step in the complete make-up ritual. Never compromise on these two. Choose from Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water or M.A.C. Demi Wipes from a wide range available. For moisturizer, it’s safe to test on your skin and then go for one that suits you best.</p>\r\n                                                    <p>So, this list of essentials is barely a glimpse of what all products go into that magical vanity box of a bride, of course differing as per the taste of every girl and her love for all things beauty. There are more tit-bits one can add to this and this tells you how much of a hard work it is to successfully put a vanity together.</p>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n
